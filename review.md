## Technical Debt to Address
1. Implement proper error handling for all database operations
2. Add input validation for all forms
3. Set up proper logging
4. Implement rate limiting
5. Add proper TypeScript types for all components

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Complete the authentication flow
2. Implement the project creation interface
3. Set up the task management system
4. Configure email notifications
5. Add basic error handling and loading states

## Notes
- The current setup provides a solid foundation for the MVP
- All core infrastructure is in place
- Focus should be on implementing core features before adding advanced functionality
- Regular testing and user feedback should be incorporated throughout development
